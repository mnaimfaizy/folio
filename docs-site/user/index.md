# What is Folio?

Folio is a **self-hosted book collection manager**. You install it on your own computer or server and use it through a web browser — no accounts, no subscriptions, no data sent to third parties.

Think of it as your personal digital library that you fully own and control.

---

## What can you do with it?

- **Add books** — manually or by searching OpenLibrary / Google Books by title or ISBN.
- **Add authors** — with biographies, birth dates, and photos pulled from public sources.
- **Track loans** — lend books to friends or colleagues and track return dates.
- **Accept requests** — let registered users request books through the app.
- **Showcase your collection** — make a public catalog page that anyone can browse.
- **Manage from mobile** — companion iOS/Android app for quick access on the go.

## Three ways to use Folio

Folio has three **profiles** that change how the app behaves:

| Profile             | Best for                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single User**     | One person managing their own books privately                     |
| **Library**         | A team or small library with multiple users and lending workflows |
| **Public Showcase** | Displaying a collection online without borrowing features         |

You switch profiles in the admin settings — no reinstall required.
