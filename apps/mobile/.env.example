# Mobile app environment variables
#
# This app currently reads its API URL from `apps/mobile/app.json`:
#   expo.extra.apiUrl (e.g. http://localhost:3000/api)
#
# If you later switch to an `app.config.js` setup, you can plumb an
# EXPO_PUBLIC_* env var into `extra.apiUrl`.
# Must include `/api` for the mobile app (its client uses `/api` as the base path)
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
